== What is it? ==

zenodotus.repy is a DNS Name server application built in repy which services DNS queries as you might expect, but rather than returning data from the domain name service, it returns information on seattle nodes which it gets from the central advertise server.



== How do I use it? ==

General instructions for use are as follows:

Supposing that you wish to host a web page titled "helloworld" on multiple nodes, add the following line of code to your program:


{{{
advertise_announce('helloworld.zenodotus.cs.washington.edu', getmyip(), 600)
}}}

(Note that for this to work, you must be including the advertise.repy module.)

When running in a node, this will associate helloworld.zenodotus.cs.washington.edu with your node's IP Address for 600 seconds. Six hundred seconds is just an example, since it is best to refresh the entry rather than leaving it there for a long time. If you are running this program on multiple nodes simultaneously, this will result in helloworld.zenodotus.cs.washington.edu being associated with all of their IP Addresses, and a random one will be used when a user tries to connect to your site via browser.

If you're running in a node, your users will need to append your GENIPORT to the end of the IP Address in their browsers. For example, a user could access your page with this URL: 'helloworld.zenodotus.cs.washington.edu:631XX', but they would not connect properly if the port were not specified.



== Debugging ==

It is important to note that we currently only support simple A lookup queries. A functionality expansion is being worked on, and can be expected fairly soon. For now, however, just remember that there is no support for other query types.
