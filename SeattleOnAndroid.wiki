DISCLAIMER: For the moment, I'm only collecting my notes on this page. Any feedback (to albert.rafetseder@univie.ac.at) is appreciated to make it work and then turn this page into an installation instruction like wiki:SeattleOnNokia

And no, neither running Repy scripts locally nor donating vessels currently work. Sorry!

[http://cs.univie.ac.at/research/research-groups/future-communication/ Our] device here is a ZTE Blade Android 2.3 ("Gingerbread") phone running Cyanogenmod 7.

= Setting up Python =

As far as I know, you cannot install Python as a standalone app right now. Therefore, these steps cover the installation of the Scripting Layer for Android, into which the actual Python interpreter will be installed. (Note to self: Restore our phone from a plain image and try out all the steps. I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something.)

 1. On the home screen, press ''Menu''. Go to ''Settings > Applications'' and make sure ''Unknown Sources'' is checked. This is needed for installing non-Market APKs right after downloading them.
 1. Download the Scripting Layer for Android ([http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/ SL4A]) from [http://android-scripting.googlecode.com/files/sl4a_r4.apk here]. Tap on the download notification to install.
 1. Download the Python 2.6.2 interpreter for Android ([Py4A]) from [http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/downloads/detail?name=PythonForAndroid_r4.apk&can=2&q= here]. Again, tap on the download notification to install. Congratulations! You can now run Python code from within SL4A, either using scripts from files or an interactive interpreter.
 1. Undo Step 1 for obvious security reasons.

For running Repy programs locally, SL4A is not the optimal choice, but shell access to the Python interpreter is tricky to add because the shell knows nothing about Python's paths yet. Depending on which shell you have, there are different routes to take from here.

For {{{sh}}} (which is the default shell also greeting you via [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html adb]'s {{{shell}}} command), I don't know yet where it takes its run commands (.shrc) from. If you have [https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/wiki Jackpal's AndroidTerm2] installed, you can write an rc script and configure AndroidTerm to run it on startup: Press ''Menu'', go to ''Settings > Start command'' and enter /path/to/your/script.

For {{{bash}}}, add the following lines to {{{/system/etc/bash/bashrc}}} (Make sure /system/etc is mounted writable by issuing {{{mount -o rw,remount /system}}} as the superuser) :
{{{
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib
export PYTHONPATH=/mnt/sdcard/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/extras/python:/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6:/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload
export PYTHONHOME=/data/data/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/files/python
export TEMP=$TEMP:/mnt/sdcard/com.googlecode.pythonforandroid/extras/python/tmp/
}}}

These lines are inspired by [http://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/source/browse/python-build/standalone_python.sh this file in the Py4A repository], but not all of their path names work on our phone. I'm not blaming the original authors -- pathnames are a botch in Android, everything shows up in multiple places (/etc == /system/etc and so on), and all of a sudden you find yourself on a device not supporting links (sdcard, its filesystem is VFAT) or mounted read-only but listed as temp directory.

On my installation with {{{bash}}}, the Python interpreter can now be run from any path in the filesystem, and can {{{import socket}}} etc.

You can now download and unzip Seattle to a folder of your choice.


= Seattle =
After downloading and unzipping the Seattle Linux installer, I'm currently out of luck. One issue is with the Seattle install.sh files (one in {{{seattle}}}, the other in {{{seattle/seattle_repy}}}) as the shell is not located in {{{/bin/sh}}} on Android, but in {{{/system/bin/sh}}}. If you downloaded Seattle to the standard download folder on the SD card, it won't run (stating "Bad interpreter: Permission denied") unless you remount the card with the {{{exec}}} option (as hinted in the [http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDcQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fubuntuforums.org%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D27138&ei=uQCyTcTYBsWZOt2-1PgI&usg=AFQjCNExH-jP9IMTAfbYdNgrWKZoXF_9iA Ubuntu forums]).

If I do {{{python seattleinstaller.py}}}, I'm back to the prompt immediately. It turns out this is a sub-sub-sub shell, so if I {{{exit}}} thrice, I am finally presented with an error relating to 

{{{nix_common_api.py, line 23
    _strerror = libc.strerror
  File "..../lib/python2.6/ctypes/__init__.py", line 366, in __getattr__
  File "..../lib/python2.6/ctypes/__init__.py", line 371, in __getitem__
AttributeError: Symbol not found:
}}}

(The ellipsis conceals the build directory on a machine of a Py4A developer.)
The same thing happens when I run {{{python repy.py restrictions.none test.repy}}} from the command line.

I can also reproduce the triple-sub shell if I try this almost verbatim copy of {{{nix_common_api.py}}} in the interpreter:

{{{
import ctypes
import ctypes.util
ctypes.util.find_library("c") # Differs from Seattle source file
}}}

It doesn't crash, but puts me back into the interpreter.

Any help is welcome.
