= Beta Clearing House =

The Beta Clearing House is the machine that holds the beta version of our public clearing house as well as a small beta network where a 
handful of Seattle nodes are deployed for beta testing. Everything that is pushed on to the production must first be deployed on the 
Beta Clearing House and tested for bugs and discrepancies before we can safely push it to the production clearinghouse or the production
nodes.

The beta clearinghouse is a collection of nodes that runs on the beta testbed. The beta version may have bugs in them as this is where the developers
test out all the latest features of the product. The clearinghouse consists of the main front end webserver which allows users to register or login to
their public testbed account in order to donate or acquire nodes in order to run their experiment.

The service is run under the user: '''geni'''
