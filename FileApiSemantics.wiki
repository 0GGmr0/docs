== Introduction and Purpose ==
----

This page is designed to specify, in detail, the behavior of File API calls under various circumstances.  For each call a list of argument and behavioral semantics is provided, along with a snippet of test code that shows how each case is verified -- hopefully in much the same style as the NetworkApiSemantics page.

== fobj.close() ==
----

=== Interacts with: ===

All fobj methods that require a file to be open.

=== Argument Semantics: ===

None.

=== Behavioral Semantics: ===

1

Action: Close is called on an open file object.

Result: The file obj is closed. Read and write operations can no longer be performed.

(tested - fobj_close_basic.py)
Test Snippet:

{{{

fobj = open(filename)
fobj.close()
try:
  fobj.read(1)
except:
  pass
else:
  test_fail()

}}}

2

Action: Close is called on an allready closed file object.

Result: False is returned, no exception occurs.

(tested - fobj_close_duplicate.py)

Test Snippet:

{{{

fobj = open(filename)
fobj.close()
fobj.close()

}}}

3

Action: Close is called and the attempts are made to read or write from the file.

Result: An exception occurs.

(tested under other file_object methods)
