= Running the Security Layer Benchmarks =

== Setup ==
First it is necessary to setup a folder to run the benchmarks. This can be done like so:

{{{
cd $SEATTLE/branches/repy_v2/
mkdir bench/
python preparetest.py bench
cp benchmarking-support/* bench/
}}}

== Running the Benchmarks ==
Each type of benchmark has it's own script to initiate the benchmarks.
 * To run the basic overhead tests, invoke ./benchmark.sh
 * To run the allpairsping test, invoke ./benchmark-allpairs.sh
 * To run the richards test, invoke ./benchmark-richards.sh
 * To run the webserver tests, run ./benchmark-webserver.sh and then ./benchmark-webserver-meg.sh
 * To run the blocking storage server tests, run ./benchmark-blockstore.py

Each benchmark file has some configurable settings that can be edited. For example, the number and type of security layers to benchmark with may be changed. This is done by changing the constants in the bash files.
