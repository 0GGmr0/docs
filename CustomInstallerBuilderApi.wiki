= Seattle Custom Installer Builder Future API =

'''Note:''' The current customized installer builder does not have a functioning XML-RPC interface. A new version will be released soon. This page documents the future behavior of the XML-RPC interace.

The [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/CustomizedInstaller customized installer builder] creates an installer according to user specifications, and returns a URL at which the user can pick up the installer.

The following procedure calls will be supported:

 * api_version()
 * build_installers(vessels, platforms, user_data=None)
 * build_simple_installer(owner_public_key, user_public_key, platform)
