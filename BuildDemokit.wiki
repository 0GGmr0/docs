= Building the Demokit =

The script `build_demokit.py` provides a quick and easy way to prepare a demokit. It bundles a set of demo programs along with the most recent versions of necessary Seattle core files into a downloadable tarball.


== Usage ==
`build_demokit.py` can be run from anywhere, assuming you have access to a working copy of the trunk of the Seattle Subversion repository.

Kits currently include the following demo programs:
 * A simple all-pairs-ping program run via [SeattleShell Seash]
 * An all-pairs-ping Google Maps mashup
 * UDP ping connectivity-measuring programs

`build_demokit.py` can be run thusly:
{{{
$ python build_demokit.py path/to/trunk output/directory
}}}

Please refer to the following example usage:

{{{
Seattle/trunk$ mkdir ../demokit_test
Seattle/trunk$ python dist/build_demokit.py . ../demokit_test
Creating a demokit. This may take a moment or two.
Demokit created: Seattle/demokit_test/seattle_demokit.tgz
Seattle/trunk$ cd ../demokit_test && ls
seattle_demokit.tgz
}}}
