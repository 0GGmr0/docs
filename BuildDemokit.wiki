= Building the Demokit =

The script `dist/build_demokit.py` provides a quick and easy way to prepare a demokit. It bundles a set of demo programs along with the most recent versions of necessary Seattle core files into a downloadable tarball.


== Usage ==
`build_demokit.py` can be run from anywhere, assuming you have access to a working copy of the trunk of the Seattle Subversion repository.

Kits currently include the following demo programs:
 * A simple all-pairs-ping program run via [SeattleShell Seash]
 * An all-pairs-ping Google Maps mashup
 * UDP ping connectivity-measuring programs

`build_demokit.py` can be run thusly:
{{{
$ python build_demokit.py path/to/trunk output/directory
}}}

Please refer to the following example usage:

{{{
Seattle/trunk$ mkdir ../demokit_test
Seattle/trunk$ python dist/build_demokit.py . ../demokit_test
Creating a demokit. This may take a moment or two.
Demokit created: Seattle/demokit_test/seattle_demokit.tgz
Seattle/trunk$ cd ../demokit_test && ls
seattle_demokit.tgz
}}}


The script as of August 2010 seems to make a tarball of the demokit, while the demokit on the website is in zip format. Therefore after you have made the demokit using the script above, untar it using 'tar -zxvf' command. At this point we want to make sure that there aren't any extra files in the demokit or none of the files have been deleted. You can do this by comparing to the last version of the demokit. The current demokit should reside in /var/www/dist/ on seattlegeni.cs.washington.edu. After everything checks out use the command 'zip -r' to zip up the latest demokit and move it to the folder /var/www/dist/ in seattlegeni.cs.washington.edu replacing the old demokit.
