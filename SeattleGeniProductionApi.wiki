= Production Geni XMLRPC Service =

The Geni XMLRPC service is available at https://seattlegeni.cs.washington.edu/xmlrpc/

== Setup Notes ==

The plain-http server runs locally on port 8000. (TODO: firewall this off/listen only locally so people can't get to it insecurely.)

It is made available through the secure url with the addition of the following to SSL !VirtualHost in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/000-default

{{{
    <Location /xmlrpc>
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteRule .* http://localhost:8000/ [P,L]
    </Location>
}}}

Note that for the proxy to work, the apache modules {{{proxy}}} and {{{proxy_http}}} had to be enabled, which on this debian-based system was done like this:

{{{
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
}}}
