At the bottom of the page, you will find packages available for download. Unfortunately we haven't quite finished an installer yet, but you are welcome to try running what we've got - it's just not ready to be permanently installed on your computer. If you'd like to run Seattle anyway, just follow the directions for your OS.

WINDOWS:
 1. Download seattle_win.zip and save it somewhere handy.
 1. Extract the contents of the folder to wherever you'd like to run the program from, for now.
 1. Navigate to the folder you just extracted all the files into, and double click RUNME.bat.
 1. Seattle should now be running! To double check that it is, look in your Task Manager for the process "pythonw.exe".

LINUX:
 1. Download seattle_linux.tgz and save it somewhere handy.
 1. Extract the tarball into a folder that you want to work in.
 1. Navigate to that folder and run RUNME.sh.
 1. If you have Python 2.5, the program will start, otherwise it will fail, since 2.5 is the only version we support right now.
 1. To check that seattle is running, try "ps -f | grep nmmain.py | grep -v grep" or something similar.
