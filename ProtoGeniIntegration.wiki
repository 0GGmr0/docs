== Introduction ==
This is an XML-RPC interface that integrates the SeattleGENI project with the Protogeni project. This allows users from different project to acquire resources from the SeattleGENI project as long as they have the proper credentials. SeattleGENI has implemented the two api calls: !CreateSliver() and !DeleteSlice(). These two calls allow users to acquire resources and release resources from the SeattleGENI project. The XML-RPC server is located at !https://blackbox.cs.washington.edu/xmlrpc/ A tarball of the XML-RPC server as well as the components required to set it up is attached at the bottom of this page.

== !CreateSliver(argument_dict) ==
----
!CreateSliver is used to acquire resources from the SeattleGENI project. It takes in a dictionary with three items: slice_urn, rspec and a list of credentials. The dictionary is of the form:
{{{
   {'slice_urn'   : "urn:publicid:IDN+SeattleGENI+slice+mytestslice",
    'rspec'       : "some_integer", 
    'credentials' : [list_of_credentials]}
}}}
  1. slice_urn - slice_urn is an urn that describes what slice you want. A description of what urns are can be found [http://www.protogeni.net/trac/protogeni/wiki/URNs here] 
  1. rspec - rspec is an integer in string form. The integer can be between 1-10. A rspec value of 0 or over 10 will return an unsuccessful result. 
  1. credentials - credentials is a list of credential that the user can provide. The list for this call should only contain one credential. If more then one credential is provided, then an unsuccessful result is returned. To see what a credential should look like, check below.
