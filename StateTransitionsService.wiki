The state transition daemons track node configuration state. Primarily they are responsible for configuring a new Seattle installation for use by the GENI.

Each state transition daemon is a python script that runs '''all the time'''. These scripts are essential because they configure newly installed Seattle nodes for use by the GENI. Each script ''transitions'' the node from some prior state to a new state. The transition might require sending commands to the node manager, creating new database records, etc. Here are the three state transition scripts that run on seattlegeni.cs:

 * donationtocanonical -- transition a node from a newly installed state (donation state) into the canonical state
 * canonicaltoonepercent -- transitions a node from the canonical state into the one percent state in which the node is ready to be used by GENI
 * onepercenttoonepercent -- transitions a node from the one percent state back into the one percent state, updating some time-dependent information about the node in the database
