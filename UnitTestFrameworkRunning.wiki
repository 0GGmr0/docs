= Running Tests Under the Unit Testing Framework =

You've written your unit tests so that they work under the unit testing framework, but how do you run them?

[[BR]]

== Setup ==

Before you can actually begin running your tests, you need to set them up correctly. There are a few requirements that need to be fulfilled:

1) All of your unit tests must have a '.py' extension.

All of your python unit tests should already have this extension, but your repy files should not. A good extension to use for your repy unit testing files is '.mix'. This indicates that they haven't yet been preprocessed and can't run. To preprocess your files, use the command:

{{{

python repypp.py ut_tests_filetobeprocessed.mix ut_tests_filetobeprocessed.py

}}}

The first argument to python, repypp.py, is the preprocessor for repy files. It must be used before running repy files. The second argument is your repy unit test (note that it should follow the UTF naming convention, but with a .mix extension instead). The third argument is the filename that the preprocessor will process the file into.
  

== Running Unit Tests ==

There are three different ways you can run tests.

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py

}}}

 * Run all tests for a specific module

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py --module <module name>
$ utf.py -m <module name>

}}}

 * Run a specific test file.

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py --file <file>
$ utf.py -f <file>

}}}

All you have to do now is run the UTF, specifying ''monitor'' as the module to test.

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py -m monitor
Testing module: monitor
  Running ut_monitor.py                   [ PASS }

$
}}}
