= Running Tests for UTF =

You've written your unit tests so that they work under the unit testing framework, but how do you run them?

=== Invocation ===
----

Logically, now you would like to run your tests. This is done by invoking '''utf.py'''. When running tests, you are presented with three different possibilities:

 * Run all tests for all modules in the current directory:

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py

}}}

 * Run all tests for a specific module

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py --module <module name>
$ utf.py -m <module name>

}}}

 * Run a specific test file.

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py --file <file>
$ utf.py -f <file>

}}}

All you have to do now is run the UTF, specifying ''monitor'' as the module to test.

{{{
#!python

$ utf.py -m monitor
Testing module: monitor
  Running ut_monitor.py                   [ PASS }

$
}}}
