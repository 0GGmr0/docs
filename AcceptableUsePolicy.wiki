= Acceptable Use Policy =

For the most part, the things that you shouldn't do aren't supported by the API. You're welcome to use our code for commercial projects, etc. Please see [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/browser/seattle/trunk/LICENSE.txt our license] for details. 

Our use policy is roughly modeled on the [http://www.planet-lab.org/aup PlanetLab Acceptable Use Policy].  The main things to know are: 1) no illegal activity, 2) don't try to hack into Seattle user machines (if you want to test a vulnerability, let us know, we have machines set aside for this), and 3) even if the system doesn't have outgoing or incoming IP / port restrictions, don't abuse this. Basically, it boils down to treating the system as though you're a network admin and it's on your network.
