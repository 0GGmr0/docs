= Configuring SVN on Windows =
This is a guide on setting up SVN for developers running Windows.

== Get SVN ==
Download the `win32svn` installer from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn/files/1.6.17/Setup-Subversion-1.6.17.msi/download]

Install it.

=== Configure icon paths ===
For some reason, the environment variables for the icons are not set by default.

The easiest way to configure it is to simply save the following code as iconv.bat file, and run it.

{{{
SET APR_ICONV_PATH = C:\Program Files\Subversion\iconv
}}}

=== Test Environment variables ===
Now that we've installed svn, we should test that it was installed correctly.

Open up a command prompt (see this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQMLOykSH4 video] for details), and type `svn --version`, and hit the `enter` key. The output should be similar to the following:
{{{
C:\Users\User>svn --version

svn, version 1.6.17 (r1128011)

   compiled Jun  2 2011, 23:35:08

}}}

The next thing to test is that the path to the iconv folder was set correctly. To do that, type `echo %APR_ICONV_PATH%` into the command prompt, and hit `enter`. The output should be similar to the following:
{{{
C:\Users\User> echo %APR_ICONV_PATH%
C:\Program Files\Subversion\iconv
}}}

== Set up SSH keys ==

=== Generate the keys ===
<Generate key pic>
Save as:

Private Key: id_rsa
<FIND BEST LOC TO STORE PRIVATE KEY>

=== Upload the keys ===
Download winscp from here: http://winscp.net/download/winscp435.zip
< winscp connect dialog>

== Possible Errors ==

=== Unable to use key file ===
