== Getting the SDK ==
----

To build the APK file, you must first download the Android SDK.   It is recommended you install every version of Android > 2.1 (API > 7) because Seattle runs on all of these platforms.   

To do the installation, download and unzip the file.   On some platforms, you then need to run tools/android to do the actual installation and download.

== Getting the APK source ==
----

The APK source for Seattle On Android is located in SVN under trunk/dist/android/SeattleOnAndroid.   You will need to create a {{{local.properties}}} file in this directory which refers to your SDK install location.   The contents of this file will look like this:

{{{sdk.dir=/Users/justincappos/android-sdk-macosx/}}}  

'''Do not use '~' characters as ant does not seem to support them well'''
