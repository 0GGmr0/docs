== Getting the SDK ==
----

To build the APK file, you must first download the Android SDK.   It is recommended you install every version of Android > 2.1 (API > 7) because Seattle runs on all of these platforms.   

To do the installation, download and unzip the file.   On some platforms, you then need to run tools/android to do the actual installation and download.

== Getting Seattle On Android Ready To Build ==
----

The APK source for Seattle On Android is located in SVN under {{{trunk/dist/android/SeattleOnAndroid}}}.   You will need to create a {{{local.properties}}} file in this directory which refers to your SDK install location.   The contents of this file will look something like this, be sure to replace the sdk.dir with the appropriate one for your system:
{{{ 
target=android-7
sdk.dir=/Users/justincappos/android-sdk-macosx/ 
}}}

'''Do not use '~' characters as ant does not seem to support them well'''

Now you need to update the project so that it is ready to build.   From the SeattleOnAndroid directory, do:

{{{
android update project --name SeattleOnAndroid --target android-16 --path . 
}}}

Note that if android (from your isn't in your path you will need to specify the full path for it.

== Building the APK ==
----

At this point, you should be able to build the APK by running {{{ant debug}}} from the {{{trunk/dist/android/SeattleOnAndroid}}} directory.   This will create a release that is signed with the debug key.

You can also do {{{ant release}}} to create a version of the APK that is ready for release, but is unsigned.
