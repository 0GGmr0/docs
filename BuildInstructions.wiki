= Build Instructions =
This page guides you through building the components of [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed Seattle Testbed]. The first section discusses what is required to get hold of a component's source code repository and build from it so that the component can be run. The second section describes how to run unit tests which ensure that the component works properly. The last part explains how our initialize and build scripts work behind the scenes.

== Prerequisites ==
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following pieces of software on your computer:
 * [https://www.python.org/downloads/ Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7].
 * [http://www.git-scm.com/download Git 1.7] (or later)

Many operating systems (such as Linux and Mac OS X) ship with these installed. On Windows, you will need to install Git before you can continue.

''Note: Please double-check your Python version! We don't support Python 3 at the moment.''



== Building components ==
This section describes how to build components from their source repositories on [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed GitHub], using the command line. We'll use a Unix-like system throughout our examples. Windows users should use Windows !PowerShell or Command Prompt.

Currently, components that have been set up to be buildable and runnable are `seash`, `repy_v2`, `overlord`, and `experimentmanager`. The other components can be built for unit test mode (see below).

'''Note:''' Overlord and Experiment Manager are currently being ported to RepyV2 and will not fully work.[[BR]]


1. Clone the repository that you want to build from [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed SeattleTestbed].[[BR]]
For example, if you are building [wiki:SeattleShell seash], do: 
{{{
#!sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/seash
}}}
If you usually use `SSH` instead of `https` to clone your git repos, you can do:
{{{
#!sh
$ git clone git@github.com:SeattleTestbed/seash.git
}}}

Of course, you will want to replace `seash` with the repository name you are interested in.

2. This yields a folder named like the repository you cloned. Inside of it, there is a `scripts/` folder which in turn contains a script called `initialize.py` to fetch the dependencies of this component. Continuing with our example `seash`:[[BR]]
{{{
#!sh
$ cd seash/scripts
$ python initialize.py
}}}
`initialize.py` Git-clones the dependent repositories into `DEPENDENCIES` directory which will be created as a sub-directory inside your main repository. It takes its instructions from `config_initialize.txt` to fetch the dependencies.[[BR]]

3. To build a runnable component from the source dependencies, run the `scripts/build.py` script. You may supply it an optional target folder for the build (which must be created first):
{{{
#!sh
$ mkdir TARGET_FOLDER
$ python build.py TARGET_FOLDER
}}}
If you don't setup a target directory, `build.py` will itself create a target folder named `RUNNABLE` which will be a sub-directory inside the component's main repository, e.g. `seash/RUNNABLE`.[[BR]]

`build` will copy all the files necessary to build the particular Seattle Component into the target directory. It will indirectly call `../DEPENDENCIES/common/build_component.py` and make use of `config_build.txt` in order to fetch the list of files and directories to copy to target.[[BR]]

'''Done! ''' Your target folder now contains a runnable version of the component! [[BR]]



== Building and Running Unit Tests ==
When making changes to the code (or build scripts!) you will want to ensure that the change does not have side effects or breaks functionality that had been working before. In order to ensure this, most components are ''testable'' and come with a set of ''unit tests'' (''Testable'' components have `tests` or `test` directory within their repository) .

The steps of the previous section intrinsically downloaded the required unit test files. You just need to run the build script again to create a ''testable'' build. Use the `-t` command line option to indicate you want the test files to be included. Again, specifying a target directory is optional!
{{{
#!sh
$ mkdir TEST_TARGET_DIR
$ cd COMPONENT/scripts
$ python build.py -t TEST_TARGET_DIR
}}}

Then, change to the test target directory (which will either be `RUNNABLE` or your `TEST_TARGET_DIR`), and start the unit tests:
{{{
#!sh
$ cd TEST_TARGET_DIR
$ python utf.py -a
}}}

The unit test framework prints out the test name and result (plus debugging information if available), e.g.:
{{{
	Running: ut_nm_addfiletovessel.r2py                         [ PASS ]
}}}

[[BR]]



== How The Build Process Works ==

The Seattle build procedure makes use of three scripts, `initialize.py`, `build.py` and `build_component.py`, and two sets of configuration instructions, `config_initialize.txt` and `config_build.txt`.

`config_initialize.txt` provides `initialize.py` with Git links to dependent repositories. `initialize` then Git-clones from there. Usually, we link to our main repositories, [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed github/SeattleTestbed], but linking to other repos is common during development. Note that links may include branch or commit specifiers so as to enable release management ("tagging").

`config_build.txt` provides `build_component.py` with the names and paths of necessary files that are to be copied over from the cloned repos to the target directory to build the required Seattle component.

`build.py` is a wrapper-script that automates the running of `build_component.py` from inside the `scripts/` directory of a component, so that users don't need to leave the scripts directory in order to run `build.py`.

A sample `config_initialize.txt` looks like this:
{{{
# This config was used for an old version of the custominstallerbuilder.
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v1 ../DEPENDENCIES/repy_v1
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/repy_v2 ../DEPENDENCIES/repy_v2
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/seattlelib_v1 ../DEPENDENCIES/seattlelib_v1
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/seattlelib_v2 ../DEPENDENCIES/seattlelib_v2
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/nodemanager ../DEPENDENCIES/nodemanager
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/softwareupdater ../DEPENDENCIES/softwareupdater
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/portability ../DEPENDENCIES/portability
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/common ../DEPENDENCIES/common
https://github.com/aaaaalbert/affix.git -b minimal-clean-alpha-release ../DEPENDENCIES/affix
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/clearinghouse ../DEPENDENCIES/clearinghouse
https://github.com/aaaaalbert/seash.git -b sync-with-affix-alpha-release ../DEPENDENCIES/seash
https://github.com/SeattleTestbed/resource.git ../DEPENDENCIES/resource
}}}

Here is the corresponding {{{config_build.txt}}}:
{{{
# Build file for the Repy runtime that the custominstallerbuilder requires. 
./*
DEPENDENCIES/repy_v2/*
DEPENDENCIES/portability/*
DEPENDENCIES/seattlelib_v2/*
DEPENDENCIES/seash/*
DEPENDENCIES/clearinghouse/xmlrpc_clients/seattleclearinghouse_xmlrpc.py
DEPENDENCIES/affix/*
DEPENDENCIES/affix/components/*

# Tests
test ./tests/*
}}}


One can add comments to the configuration files by prefixing lines with `#`. [[BR]]
Within `config_build.txt`, lines starting with `test ` specify the test files (or file patterns) that are copied over to the target directory if the build script is called in test mode (`build.py -t target_dir`). [[BR]]



The required directory layout for a repository supporting this build method is this:

{{{
the_component/     # Repo base directory, includes code etc.
the_component/scripts/
the_component/scripts/initialize.py
the_component/scripts/build.py
the_component/scripts/config_initialize.txt
the_component/scripts/config_build.txt
the_component/DEPENDENCIES/common/build_component.py
}}}

'''Note:''' `build_component.py` is not part of `scripts/`. Running `initialize.py` clones the dependent repositories into `the_component/DEPENDENCIES/`, and one of these cloned dependencies is `common` which contains `build_component.py`. Users don't need to manually run `build_component.py` script. The script `scripts/build.py` indirectly runs `build_component.py` and takes care of it.
