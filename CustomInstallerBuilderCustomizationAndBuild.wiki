= Customize and build your base installers =
This page describes the customizations to code required before you can build base installers, and also the actual build process. We assume you have [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderInstallation installed] and [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderConfiguration configured] the Custom Installer Builder already.

== Set nodemanager version ==
In `$REPO_PARENT_DIR` there is a subdirectory for the `nodemanager`. Go there, and edit `nmmain.py`. It includes a line starting with `version = `.

Change the version string to reflect your project / clearinghouse / Custom Installer Builder name, and also the current build. You will later need this string when launching the build script.

'''NOTE: This string will be used as a part of the base installer's file name. Use only printable, non-whitespace, ASCII characters that do not require escaping! ''' Avoid tabs and spaces, forward and backslashes (`/\`), quotes/ticks of all kinds (`'"`), shell glob characters (`?`, `*`), and other characters with special meanings to the shell (`#&><|()[]{}!$;~` etc.).

A-Z, a-z, 0-9, `.` (period), `-` (dash), `_` (underscore) are fine.


== Check softwareupdater URL and key pair ==
Remember the public/private key pair whose filenames and paths you [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderConfiguration#Adaptthebuildscripts configured] in the build script? In order for your installers to be able to validate updates that you push, the `softwareupdater` component must include your (or your update site's) public key.

For this, change into the `softwareupdater` subdir of `custominstallerbuilder/scripts/` and edit `softwareupdater.py`. On the line starting with `softwareupdatepublickey = `, replace the value under the key `'e'` of the dict with the first int of your public key, and the value of key `'n'` with the second.

Furthermore, change the line starting with `softwareurl = ` to contain your softwareupdater's URL.

Done? Great, because that's all of the customization required! Let's build installers now!



== Building base installers ==

Go back to `$REPO_PARENT_DIR/dist` where `rebuild_base_installers_for_seattlegeni.sh` resides. Run the script, supplying it the nodemanager `version` string you set earlier.

{{{
#!sh
$ ./rebuild_base_installers_for_seattlegeni.sh YOUR-VERSION-STRING
}}}

After a bit of processing and signing files with the softwareupdater's cryptographic key, the base installers are ready in the `$BASE_INSTALLER_DIRECTORY` you set (`/var/www/dist` per default).

Continue now to [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderTesting testing] or [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderDeployment deploying in production] the Custom Installer Builder.
