= Performance Isolation Benchmarks =

== Setup ==
First it is necessary to setup a folder to run the benchmarks. This can be done like so:

{{{
cd $SEATTLE/branches/repy_v2/
mkdir bench/
python preparetest.py bench
cp benchmarking-support/* bench/
cp for_test/* bench/
}}}

The for_test.zip can be found in this page.

== Running the Benchmarks ==
Each type of benchmark has it's own script to initiate the benchmarks.
 * To run the cpu bomb tests, invoke ./cpubomb.sh
 * To run the fork bomb test, invoke ./fork.sh
 * To run the disk bomb test, invoke ./disk.sh
 * To run the memory bomb tests, run ./memory.sh


== Result of the benchmarks ==
The benchmarks will return several result files to illustrate the isolation of Seattle. 
The results of benchmarks are related to the kind of them, for example: cpu bomb are cpu1.txt, cpu2.txt, cpu3.txt, cpu4.txt.

== Thanks ==
We are very appreciate it if you can send the results of the benchmarks to us with the performance of your computer(such as OS, cpu, memory, etc). And we are also very appreciate it if you can contact us if you meet any problems.
