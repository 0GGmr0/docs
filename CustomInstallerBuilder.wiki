= Using the Custom Installer Builder =

Normally, installers created through SeattleGENI subdivide a donor's resources into two vessels. As always, there is a small vessel (20%) reserved for Seattle itself. The main vessel (80%) is owned by the experiment planner, and a special key is entered for the vessel user. This special key allows anybody to download a customized installer (provided through SeattleGENI) and donate their computing resources to the planner's experiment.

If the experiment planner wants to further subdivide the vessels, he can use the [https://custombuilder.poly.edu/custom_install/ Custom Installer Builder]. This tool allows the planner to create several smaller vessels in place of the larger main vessel. Each vessel can be assigned a particular owner and a number of users. Because working with cryptographic keys is awkward, the Custom Installer Builder can accept public keys from files, or generate new key pairs entirely.

On the backend, there is also an [wiki:CustomInstallerBuilderApi XML-RPC interface] to create customized installers. (In fact, this is how SeattleGENI generates the default installers it provides.)



= A Tour of the Web Interface =
[[Image(cib.png)]]

Start by opening the [https://custombuilder.poly.edu/custom_install/ Custom Installer Builder] in your web browser.

== Step 1 : Build Installers ==
First, '''create users''' in the top half of the page. You can upload a public key for existing users, or allow the Custom Installer Builder to generate cryptographic keys for you.

Next, '''create your vessels''' by splitting the main vessel as you see fit. Vessels can be split by clicking one of the "+" icons along the top edge. You can delete a created vessel by clicking the "Ã—" icon in its upper-right corner.

Finally, '''configure your vessels''' by dragging users from the top half of the page into the vessels created in the previous step. Each vessel must have a single owner, but may have any number of users. When you are ready, '''press the "Build" button''' to move to the next step.

== Step 2 : Download keys ==
Before you can download your installers, you must download the cryptographic keys for the users created in the previous step. These keys are not stored on our server after your browsing session expires.

== Step 3: Download installers ==
After you have downloaded the cryptographic keys, you are ready to download your installers! A link is provided to share these installers with others.
