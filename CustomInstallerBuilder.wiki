= Using the Customized Installer Builder =

The [http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/customized_installer/ customized installer builder] creates custom Seattle installers. This means that you can create an installer that has 4% of the resources reserved for a user Michael, while the rest are reserved for a user John. Or an installer with some other assignment of resources. The customized installer builder allows you to specify the proportion of resources each vessel will be allocated, the public\private keys of the owner for each vessel, as well as the public and private keys of the users for each vessel. Finally, you will be able to download your custom made installer for a platform of your choice.

== Step 1 : Create your users ==

Initially, the page loads with no vessels, and no users. You add new users (and optionally their public key) to the page by filling in their username and clicking 'Add'. 

== Step 2 : Create your vessels ==

Next create the vessels that you would like your Seattle installer to be configured with. You can add new vessels at the bottom box on the page by clicking +  or remove existing vessels by clicking X right above the vessel partition bar.

== Step 3 : Configure your vessels ==

Now drag the usernames appearing in the top box into the vessel boxes to associate user identities you created in Step 1 with the vessels you created in Step 2. Note that you can assign an identity to be the owner and/or a user of any one vessel. Note that you can use an identity multiple times.

== Step 4 : Build your customized installer ==

Once you are done configuring your vessels, build your customized installer by clicking 'Create Installer'. Note that this button will be disabled until every vessel has an owner associated with it.

== Step 5 : Download your customized installer ==

At the end of Step 4 you will be directed to a downloads page where you can download an installer for the platform of your choice. For more information on how to install Seattle see [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleDownload this page].
