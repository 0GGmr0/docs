= Using the Customized Installer Builder =

Normally, installers created through SeattleGENI subdivide a donor's resources into two vessels. As always, there is a small vessel (20%) reserved for Seattle itself. The main vessel (80%) is owned by the experiment planner, and a special key is entered for the vessel user. This special key allows anybody to download a customized installer (provided through SeattleGENI) and donate their computing resources to the planner's experiment.

If the experiment planner wants to further subdivide the vessels, he can use the [http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/customized_installer/ customized installer builder]. This tool allows the planner to create several smaller vessels in place of the larger main vessel. Each vessel can be assigned a particular owner and a number of users. Because working with cryptographic keys is awkward, the customized installer builder can accept public keys from files, or generate new key pairs entirely.

On the backend, there will soon be an XML-RPC interface to create customized installers. Future versions of SeattleGENI will use this interface to build all installers.

== Step 1 : Create your users ==

Initially, the page loads with no vessels, and no users. You add new users (and optionally their public key) to the page by filling in their username and clicking 'Add'. 

== Step 2 : Create your vessels ==

Next create the vessels that you would like your Seattle installer to be configured with. You can add new vessels at the bottom box on the page by clicking +  or remove existing vessels by clicking X right above the vessel partition bar.

== Step 3 : Configure your vessels ==

Now drag the usernames appearing in the top box into the vessel boxes to associate user identities you created in Step 1 with the vessels you created in Step 2. Note that you can assign an identity to be the owner and/or a user of any one vessel. Note that you can use an identity multiple times.

== Step 4 : Build your customized installer ==

Once you are done configuring your vessels, build your customized installer by clicking 'Create Installer'. Note that this button will be disabled until every vessel has an owner associated with it.

== Step 5 : Download your customized installer ==

At the end of Step 4 you will be directed to a downloads page where you can download an installer for the platform of your choice. For more information on how to install Seattle see [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleDownload this page].
