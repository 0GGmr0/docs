== Using CheckAPI ==

CheckAPI's primary version uses security layers to interpose on API calls, log them and then verify them against a model of the API. The first step in using CheckAPI is to copy all of the required files from https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/browser/seattle/branches/repy_v2/checkapi/ into a directory that contains all of the required Repy V2 files. After this you can run any application that supports Repy V2 with CheckAPI with the following command:

{{{
python repy.py <restrictions file> encasementlib.repy dylink.repy check_api.repy <program under test>
}}}
