[[BR]]
The SeattleGENI XML-RPC Client Library is a Python XMLRPC client for communicating with the SeattleGENI XML-RPC Interface.

You can download the the client from here: [source:seattle/trunk/seattlegeni/xmlrpc_clients/seattlegeni_xmlrpc.py SeattleGENI Python XMLRPC Client]. Look for the link to "original format" at the bottom of that page to download the file.

[[BR]]
=== Usage ===
  1. Download the client code linked to above (it is a Python module).
  1. In your Python script, import seattlegeni_xmlrpc.[[BR]]
  1. Create an instance (or multiple instances, if desired) of the class seattlegeni_xmlrpc.SeattleGENIClient.[[BR]]
     The following parameters can be passed to the constructor:
     * ''username'': Your username. (Required)
     * ''api_key'': Your api_key. (Required)
     * ''xmlrpc_url'': The url where the SeattleGENI XMLRPC server is located. (Defaults is our main SeattleGENI testbed's xmlrpc url.)
     * ''allow_ssl_insecure'': True/False, if set to True, allows SSL to operate in an INSECURE manner. '''Do not use allow_ssl_insecure=True in production code.''' (Default is False)
     * ''ca_certs_file'': The location of a file containing your trusted CA certificates. (Default is a file named `cacert.pem` in the same directory that you place `seattlegeni_xmlrpc.py` in.)
  1. Once a client object has been created, simply invoke the object's methods.

[[BR]]
=== Using Secure SSL ===
In order to perform secure SSL communication with SeattleGENI:
  * You must have M2Crypto installed.
  * You must set the value of CA_CERTIFICATES_FILE to the location of a PEM
    file containing CA certificates that you trust. If you don't know where
    this is on your own system, you can download this file from a site you
    trust. One such place to download this file from is: http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
        
If you can't fulfill the above requirements, you can still use this client with
XMLRPC servers that use https but you will be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
attack. To enable this insecure mode, include the argument `allow_ssl_insecure=True`
when creating a SeattleGENIClient instance.

[[BR]]
=== SeattleGENIClient Methods ===
Please note, these methods are not the same as the XML-RPC API calls.
The clientlib methods are simply convenient wrappers for those calls. 
As such, most methods here have identical return values as the actual XMLRPC calls. Refer to the [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleGeniAPI SeattleGENI XMLRPC API spec] for more info about what these functions return.

Available methods on SeattleGENIClient objects:
  The acquire methods all return a list of acquired resources, following the SeattleGENI XMLRPC API spec.
  * ''acquire_lan_resources(num)'':  Acquires ''num'' LAN vessels.
  * ''acquire_wan_resources(num)'':  Acquires ''num'' WAN vessels.
  * ''acquire_nat_resources(num)'':  Acquires ''num'' NAT vessels.
  * ''acquire_random_resources(num)'':  Acquires ''num'' random vessels.

  * ''release_resources(handlelist)'':  Release all vessels referenced by handles given in ''handlelist''.

  * ''renew_resources(handlelist)'':  Renew all vessels referenced by handles given in ''handlelist'' (that is, extend their expiration dates to 7 days from the current time).

  * ''get_resource_info()'':  Get a list of dictionaries describing all vessels currently acquired by the account. Each dictionary is of the form {'node_ip':node_ip, 'node_port':node_port, 'vessel_id':vessel_id, 'node_id':node_id, 'handle':handle, 'expires_in_seconds':seconds}

  * ''get_account_info()'':  Get account information. This is a dictionary containing the keys{'user_port', 'user_name', 'max_vessels', 'user_affiliation'}

  * ''get_public_key()'':  Get user's public key.

=== Exceptions ===
The following exceptions can be raised by SeattleGENIClient methods:[[BR]]
  * SeattleGENIError -- Base class for all exceptions raised by the SeattleGENIClient.
  * !CommunicationError -- Indicates that XMLRPC communication failed.
  * !InternalError -- Indicates an unexpected error occurred, probably either a bug in this
    client or a bug in SeattleGENI.
  * !AuthenticationError -- Indicates an authentication failure (invalid username and/or API key).
  * !InvalidRequestError -- Indicates that the request is invalid.
  * !NotEnoughCreditsError -- Indicates that the requested operation requires more vessel credits to
    be available then the account currently has.
  * !UnableToAcquireResourcesError -- Indicates that the requested operation failed because SeattleGENI was unable
    to acquire the requested resources.

See the comments in the seattlegeni_xmlrpc.py file for details on when each exception is raised.

=== Example ===
Here is an example of how to use the SeattleGENI XML-RPC Client. This could be a python script which you run.[[BR]]
