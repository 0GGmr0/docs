= How To Submit a Patch To Seattle =

More than a hundred developers have submitted code that has been accepted into our repository.   We'd love to have your contribution too!   You will find a lot of helpful information on the Contributors Page.

First of all, please check that we have not already fixed the bug that you have found or added the feature you want.   To do this, please check out the latest version of the software [https://github.com/SeattleTestbed from GitHub].   If we have fixed it, but have not yet merged it into the master and pushed the release, feel free to let us know about it and that you would like us to push!


If the patch is small (such as a one line bug fix), simply email a diff to the developers mailing list.   Please either give the commit hash or the version of the installer (look in nmmain.py) so that we know what to compare it with.

If the patch is more significant, please email the developers list. They will first create a ticket for the feature or bug.  The development team will discuss the patch on the mailing list and multiple developers will weigh in.

Larger patches also must match the CodingStyle for the project.   (A core member will do this for you for tiny patches.)   

In general, the BDFL (Justin) is very protective of the trusted code base (the Repy VM, node manager, and Software updater).   As such, you should definitely discuss any proposed feature additions to these components '''before''' writing code.

Many developers who submitted a patch ended up being part of the core team and earning commit access.   We look forward to your contributions!
