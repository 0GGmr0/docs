This page feature information and references regarding how to use write programs on Seattle.   Seattle nodes run code written in a special language called Repy.   Repy is a subset of the Python language invented specifically for Seattle.   

There are several different tutorials depending on your background. You have to install repy before starting tutorials.
You can download repy [https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/geni/download/flibble/ here].

 * [PythonTutorial All of the Python You Need to Understand Repy (and None You Don't)].   Start here if you're new to Python and Repy!

 * Or if you already know Python, get started with the [PythonVsRepy All of the Python You Need to Forget to Use Repy] guide.


After doing one of the above tutorials to learn more about the features and API for Repy, try [RepyTutorial the Repy Tutorial].  

For Repy experts, refer to the [RepyLibrary Repy Library Reference].

There is a growing list of library code you can download and use with Repy.   Much of this uses a Repy Pre-Processor (repypp) that we built.   To "include" a repy file in your source file source.repy, do {{{include filename.repy}}}.   Then run {{{python repypp.py source.repy out.repy}}}.   The file out.repy will contain the code for filename.repy included inside the code for source.repy at the appropriate place.
