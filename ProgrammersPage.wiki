This page feature information and references regarding how to use write programs on Seattle. Seattle nodes run code written in a special language called Repy. Repy is a subset of the [http://www.python.org/ Python language] (version 2.5) invented specifically for Seattle.

== Getting Repy ==
----

You will have to download and install repy before starting the tutorials below: '''[https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/geni/download/flibble/ Download repy!]'''

[[BR]]
== Tutorials ==
----

There are several starting tutorials depending on your background. 

 * [PythonTutorial All of the Python You Need to Understand Repy (and None You Don't)]. Start here if you're new to Python and Repy!

 * [PythonVsRepy All of the Python You Need to Forget to Use Repy]. Use this tutorial if you already know Python.

After completing one of the above do the [RepyTutorial Repy Tutorial]. Try this tutorial to learn more about Repy features and the language API.

== Other Resources ==
----
 * An easy way to start learning Seattle is to watch our quick 5 minute [http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/demos/ demo].

 * [RepyLibrary Repy Library Reference]. Use this reference as a quick guide to Repy's API once you are comfortable with the language.

 * There is a growing list of library code you can download and use with Repy (see [http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/trunk/seattlelib/ seattlelib] in the Seattle repository for examples). Read more in [PythonVsRepy#Importstatements this tutorial] for the details of how to include Repy code in Python programs.

#!comment
Much of this code uses a Repy Pre-Processor (repypp).  To "include" a repy file in your source file '''source.repy''', at the top of your code include {{{include filename.repy}}}.   Then run {{{python repypp.py source.repy out.repy}}}.   The '''filename.repy''' file does not need to be pre-processed. The file '''out.repy''' will contain the code for '''filename.repy''' included inside the code for '''source.repy''' at the appropriate place.

Jo√£o Moreno has also provided a [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2546 VIM syntax file] for Repy that will syntax color Repy programs.
